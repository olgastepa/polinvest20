        <h5 class="heading-five">Standby Letter of Credit(SBLC)</h5>
        <p class="description-text">Standby Letter of Credit / SBLC (MT-760) - a written obligation of the bank issuing such a letter of credit to pay a certain amount of money to the beneficiary on behalf of his client in case the client / buyer cannot fulfill his financial obligations to the seller / beneficiary.</p>
        <p class="description-text">A standby letter of credit is a sign of trust and serves as evidence of financial reliability and solvency.</p>
        <p class="description-text">A standby letter of credit is usually used in trade transactions, for example, when purchasing goods from a local supplier or foreign exporter. A standby letter of credit can also serve as collateral for a loan, and is an ideal solution for a company that plans to expand its business, but does not want to use its assets for this.</p>
        <p class="description-text">A standby letter of credit is always issued as an irrevocable financial instrument, and cannot be revoked or canceled after it was issued by the bank and transmitted in the form of an authenticated MT-760 message via the SWIFT system. A standby letter of credit may be transferred or transferred to another beneficiary / party at the written direction of the first beneficiary. The transferring bank must notify the issuing bank of the amount and date of transfer.</p>
        <p class="description-text">A standby letter of credit is granted according to the latest edition of the unified rules for standby letters of credit (ICC Publication No. 600).</p>

        <h5 class="heading-five">Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL)</h5>
        <p class="description-text">A confirmation letter from the bank (Bank Confirmation Letter / Bank Capability Letter) - BCL (MT-799) is a letter issued by the bank on behalf of its client (buyer who has concluded a contract for the purchase of a large number of goods, which confirms the financial ability to fulfill its obligations under the conditions It also shows that the buyer has sufficient funds and financial capabilities to complete the transaction, however, it should be clearly understood that the confirmation letter from the bank (BCL) does not mean any guarantee of payment.</p>
        <p class="description-text">If the buyer claims that he has the financial ability to purchase products through his bank by providing such a notification via SWIFT message MT799, he indirectly confirms that he has enough money to receive the loan necessary to finance the transaction. The BCL letter provider, the buyer's bank, must send a notification confirming this fact, which will be addressed to the supplier in connection with an irrevocable purchase order or a signed contract.</p>
        <p class="description-text">A confirmation letter from the bank is the initial guarantee provided by the buyer to his supplier at the conclusion of contracts for large amounts. This is one way to determine the solvency of the buyer. That is, if the buyer's bank cannot issue a confirmation letter before the start of the transaction, the supplier may decide that the buyer will also be unable to provide the financial instrument necessary to pay for the goods (letter of credit, standby letter of credit or bank guarantee).</p>
        <p class="description-text">BCL is a statement of fact, but not a promise issued by a bank to fulfill financial obligations. A confirmation letter from a bank (BCL) is by no means equivalent to a letter of readiness (RWA). A BCL letter is simply an authorized SWIFT message from the buyer's bank confirming his financial capabilities (we can talk about funds in his accounts or a credit line) to pay for the goods he wants to buy.</p>
